The basic premise behind auto is the creation of a path using a trajectory, inclusion of various waypoints along said trajectory that harbours data such as subsystem 
emablement, pausing in the trajectory following, and desired rotational data, and with the use of this data, the complete following of a trajecotry and enablement of 
subsystems as the result of just two input files (trajectory and waypoint), both generated from the use of an intuitive program. Essentially, this framework will 
allow for the complete disregard for any technical implementations, allowing for the path creator to focus souly on the optimization of the path and its various 
functions.
